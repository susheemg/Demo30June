"""
Agent conversation engine.

Produces an agent's turn given the conversation state. Two paths:
  - LIVE: if a provider key is configured, route through the Claude adapter using
    the system prompt from agents.build_system_prompt (best quality).
  - LOCAL (default): a deterministic, methodology-faithful stand-in so the full
    eight-stage flow runs and is testable with zero external calls.

The local path is intentionally simple but correct: it asks the right next
question per stage, advances stages, hands off to the right specialist, and at
Stage 7 issues a verdict consistent with the scoring rules in bro_engine.

"""
Central AI prompt registry.

Every user-facing AI feature resolves its system prompt through resolve(s, key)
instead of a hard-coded literal. Admins can override any prompt from the AI Control
page; overrides persist in the system config (config_store key 'ai_prompts') and are
used everywhere immediately. resolve() falls back to the registered default when there
is no override, so behaviour is identical until an admin changes something.

NOTE: the ProAssess multi-agent stage prompts and the BRO assessment rubric are
generated dynamically (per agent / per stage / per methodology) and are managed
separately — they are intentionally not in this single-prompt registry.
